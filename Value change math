/**GROWTH OF RADIUS AS FUNCTION OF POWER */

Have two points on the Cartesian graph of power vs radius

1. When power = spawnThreshold/2, radius should = maxSize
2. When power = spawnThreshold/10 (i.e. newly spawned Blob), radius should = maxSize/2

Radius is dependent variable; power is independent. Use rise/run to get gradient of linear relation

(maxSize - 2*maxSize/3)/(spawnThreshold/2 - spawnThreshold/10)
g = (maxSize/3)/(4*spawnThreshold/10)
g = 3*maxSize/(4*spawnThreshold)

Subbing into y = gx +c:

radius = (3*maxSize)/(4*spawnThreshold) * power + c

Find intercept by subbing in: When power = spawnThreshold/2, radius = maxSize

maxSize = (3*maxSize)/(4*spawnThreshold) * spawnThreshold/2 + c
maxSize = 3*maxSize/8 + c
c = 5*maxSize/8

Together:

radius = (3*maxSize)/(4*spawnThreshold) * power + (5*maxSize/8)
